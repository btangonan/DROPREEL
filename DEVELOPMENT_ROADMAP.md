# DropReel Development Roadmap

This document outlines the phased approach for implementing improvements to the DropReel application, organized in a logical sequence for efficient development.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality & Quick Wins
**Focus: Fix critical UI issues and improve basic user experience**

1. ✅ **Video player height standardization** *(COMPLETED: May 14, 2025)*
   - Implemented fixed 16:9 aspect ratio for video player using CSS padding technique
   - Used absolute positioning for video elements to eliminate height shuffling
   - Configured VideoJS with fixed aspect ratio and proper content fitting
   - Ensured consistent layout for all video types (standard, anamorphic, etc.)
   - Created snapshot backup of the working implementation

2. ✅ **Simple UI text/color changes** *(COMPLETED: May 14, 2025)*
   - Updated video title text from gray to black for improved readability
   - Enhanced visual hierarchy for video listings

3. ✅ **Improved preview/edit flow** *(COMPLETED: May 14, 2025)*
   - Added direct Edit button to reel preview page
   - Enhanced Preview button in edit page with consistent styling 
   - Implemented Save & Preview functionality with proper state handling
   - Created seamless navigation between viewing and editing states

## Phase 2: Visual Design Evolution & Content Streamlining
**Focus: Implement glassmorphism design and simplify content management**

1. **Design system update**
   - Create core design tokens for glassmorphism style
   - Implement neutral color palette
   - Add transparency effects
   - Design frosted glass UI components (cards, buttons, modals)

2. **Apply new design system across key components**
   - Update header/navigation components
   - Redesign cards and containers
   - Create new button and form styles
   - Implement consistency across the application

3. **Simplify "Add New Videos" module**
   - Remove "paste any dropbox link..." text and field
   - Remove module title "add new videos"
   - Remove "load videos" button
   - Rename "browse" button to "add new videos"
   - Apply the new glassmorphism style to this simplified module

## Phase 3: Major Layout Redesign
**Focus: Complete redesign of the reel page according to provided wireframe**

1. **Reel page redesign according to wireframe**
   - Implement new layout structure with the following sections:
     - Top row with action buttons: "CONNECT" and "ADD VIDEOS" 
     - Large "ADD TITLE HERE" header section
     - Two-column layout with "YOUR VIDEOS" (left) and "SELECTS" (right)
     - Bottom row with "THEME (MENU)" on left and "PREVIEW REEL" on right
   - Apply the glassmorphism design language throughout
   - Create a balanced layout with proper spacing and alignment
   - Ensure all components work together in the new grid-based layout

2. **Final polish and integration**
   - Ensure all previous phases work together seamlessly
   - Fine-tune animations and transitions
   - Optimize performance of video loading and playback
   - Complete end-to-end testing of revised user flows

## Implementation Considerations

- **Modular Development**: Build components that can be easily reused in the final wireframe design
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Each phase builds on the previous one, allowing for incremental improvements
- **Performance Focus**: Maintain or improve performance with each change, especially for video rendering
- **Testing**: Complete thorough testing before moving between phases

## Design References

The new design will implement a glassmorphism style, characterized by:
- Frosted glass-like elements with subtle transparency
- Soft backgrounds with blur effects
- Clean typography with strong contrast
- Minimalist UI with focused content areas
- Subtle shadows and highlights to create depth

## Wireframe Implementation

The final redesign will follow the wireframe structure with:
- Header section with title input
- Two-column layout for video management
- Simplified controls and navigation
- Clear preview functionality
- Consistent application of the glassmorphism design language
